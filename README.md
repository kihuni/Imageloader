The code aims to load multiple images from different URLs concurrently. As each image finishes loading, the progress bar updates. All the images are appended to a container for display. The code uses promises to handle the asynchronous nature of image loading, providing visual feedback to the user and ensuring that any issues (like a failed image load) are appropriately caught and reported.
